# Transformation Tools

Transformation tools help you develop, refine, and explore variations of your ideas.

## Overview

Ideatr provides several transformation tools:
- **Name Variants** - Generate name variations
- **Scaffolds** - Create structured templates
- **Mutations** - Generate idea variations
- **Expansion** - Enrich brief ideas
- **Reorganization** - Restructure idea content

## Name Variants

**What it does:** Generates variations of your idea's name (synonyms, short names, domain hacks, phonetic variants).

**When to use:**
- You need alternative names for your idea
- You're exploring branding options
- You want domain name alternatives
- You're brainstorming naming options

**How to use:**
1. Open an idea file
2. Use **"Generate Name Variants"** command
3. Review generated variants
4. Variants are saved to the idea's frontmatter

**Settings:**
- Enable/disable in **Settings → Ideatr → Name Variant Settings**
- Configure max variants (5-10, default 8)
- Auto-generate on capture (optional)
- Use LLM for intelligent name extraction (optional)

## Scaffolds

**What it does:** Generates structured templates for different idea types (project, game mechanic, narrative seed, etc.).

**When to use:**
- You want to structure your idea
- You need a template for a specific idea type
- You want to ensure you cover all important aspects

**How to use:**
1. Open an idea file
2. Use **"Generate Scaffold"** command
3. Choose scaffold type (if prompted)
4. Scaffold is appended to your idea or created as new note

**Settings:**
- Enable/disable in **Settings → Ideatr → Scaffold Settings**
- Configure default action (append vs new note)
- Customize scaffold templates

## Mutations

**What it does:** Generates variations and alternative approaches to your idea.

**When to use:**
- You want to explore different angles
- You're brainstorming alternatives
- You want to see different implementations
- You're looking for pivot opportunities

**How to use:**
1. Open an idea file
2. Use **"Generate Mutations"** command
3. Review generated variations
4. Select mutations to apply or save as new ideas

## Expansion

**What it does:** Expands brief ideas into detailed descriptions with related concepts, questions, and next steps.

**When to use:**
- You have a brief idea that needs development
- You want to explore related concepts
- You need to flesh out an idea
- You want to generate questions and next steps

**How to use:**
1. Open an idea file
2. Use **"Expand Idea"** command
3. Review expansion (preview before applying)
4. Apply expansion to your idea

**Note:** The Ideate button automatically expands ideas during capture, but you can expand further later.

## Reorganization

**What it does:** Restructures and reorganizes idea content for better clarity and flow.

**When to use:**
- Your idea content is disorganized
- You want to improve structure
- You need to reorganize sections
- You want to improve readability

**How to use:**
1. Open an idea file
2. Use **"Reorganize Idea"** command
3. Review reorganization (preview before applying)
4. Apply reorganization to your idea

## Transformation Workflow

### Recommended Workflow

1. **Capture** your idea (Save or Ideate)
2. **Expand** if needed (if not using Ideate)
3. **Generate variants** to explore naming options
4. **Generate mutations** to explore alternatives
5. **Create scaffold** to structure your idea
6. **Reorganize** for clarity and flow

### When to Transform

- **After capture**: Transform ideas to develop them further
- **Before validation**: Transform to refine before validating
- **Before elevation**: Transform to prepare for project elevation
- **Periodically**: Revisit and transform ideas as they evolve

## Settings

Configure transformation tools in **Settings → Ideatr**:
- **Name Variant Settings**: Enable, configure max variants, auto-generate
- **Scaffold Settings**: Enable, configure default action
- **Transformation behavior**: Auto-run on capture (optional)
