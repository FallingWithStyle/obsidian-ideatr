# Capture Workflows

Understanding when to use the **Save** button vs the **Ideate** button is key to efficient idea capture.

## Save vs Ideate: When to Use Each

### Save Button (⌘ Enter / Ctrl+Enter)

Use **Save** when you want to:
- Capture a quick idea without processing
- Save raw notes that you'll process later
- Capture ideas when AI isn't available
- Store ideas that don't need immediate classification

**What Save does:**
- Creates a markdown file in `Ideas/`
- Saves your raw text as-is
- Sets basic frontmatter (type, status, created date)
- No AI processing

### Ideate Button (⌥ Enter / Alt+Enter)

Use **Ideate** when you want to:
- Immediately enrich your idea with AI
- Get automatic classification and tags
- Generate a title/subject line
- Expand the idea with related concepts, questions, and next steps
- Process the idea in one action

**What Ideate does:**
- Saves your idea (same as Save)
- Auto-classifies with category and tags
- Generates a concise title/subject line
- Expands the idea with:
  - Related concepts
  - Questions to explore
  - Next steps
- All in one action!

## Best Practices

### Quick Capture Strategy

1. **Use Ideate for well-formed ideas** - If you have a clear idea, use Ideate to immediately enrich it
2. **Use Save for raw thoughts** - If you're just jotting down a quick note, use Save and process later
3. **Process later with commands** - You can always use "Classify Current Note" or "Refresh Idea" commands later

### Keyboard Shortcuts

Both buttons have customizable keyboard shortcuts:
- Default: `Cmd/Ctrl + Enter` for Save, `Alt/Option + Enter` for Ideate
- Customize in **Settings → Ideatr → Capture Modal Settings**
- Tooltips show shortcuts when you hover over buttons

### Processing Ideas Later

If you saved an idea with the Save button, you can process it later:
1. Open the idea file
2. Use **"Classify Current Note"** command to classify it
3. Use **"Refresh Idea"** to update classification and metadata
4. Use transformation commands (variants, scaffolds, etc.) as needed

## Workflow Examples

### Example 1: Quick Brainstorm
```
1. Press hotkey → Type "AI-powered recipe generator"
2. Press Save (quick capture)
3. Process later when you have time
```

### Example 2: Well-Formed Idea
```
1. Press hotkey → Type detailed idea description
2. Press Ideate (immediate AI processing)
3. Review classification and expansion
4. Continue with validation or transformation
```
