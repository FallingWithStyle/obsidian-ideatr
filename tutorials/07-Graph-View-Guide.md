# Graph View Guide

The Graph View provides an interactive visualization of your ideas and their relationships.

## Understanding the Graph

The Graph View shows:
- **Nodes** - Each idea as a node
- **Edges** - Relationships between ideas
- **Clusters** - Related ideas grouped together
- **Colors** - Category-based or age-based coloring

## Opening the Graph View

**How to open:**
1. Use **"Open Graph View"** command (Command Palette → "Ideatr: Open Graph View")
2. Or from Dashboard, switch to graph view

## Navigation

### Interacting with Nodes

**Click a node:**
- Opens the idea file
- Focuses on that idea
- Shows idea details

**Hover over a node:**
- Shows tooltip with idea information
- Displays title, category, tags, preview
- Quick preview without opening

**Right-click a node:**
- Context menu with actions
- Open, edit, classify, etc.

### Zooming and Panning

**Zoom:**
- Mouse wheel to zoom in/out
- Pinch to zoom (touch devices)
- Zoom controls in UI

**Pan:**
- Click and drag to pan
- Arrow keys to navigate
- Center on selected node

## Layout Algorithms

### Hierarchical Layout

**What it shows:**
- Tree-like structure
- Parent-child relationships
- Clear hierarchy

**When to use:**
- Viewing idea hierarchies
- Understanding relationships
- Finding root ideas

### Force-Directed Layout

**What it shows:**
- Natural clustering
- Related ideas grouped together
- Organic arrangement

**When to use:**
- Exploring relationships
- Finding clusters
- Discovering connections

### Switching Layouts

**How to switch:**
- Use layout selector in UI
- Choose algorithm from dropdown
- Layout updates automatically

## Understanding Colors

### Category-Based Coloring

**What it shows:**
- Nodes colored by category
- Same category = same color
- Visual category grouping

**How to use:**
- Quickly identify categories
- See category distribution
- Find ideas by category

### Age-Based Coloring

**What it shows:**
- Nodes colored by age
- Newer ideas = brighter colors
- Older ideas = darker colors

**How to use:**
- Identify recent ideas
- Find old ideas
- Track idea age

### Random Coloring

**What it shows:**
- Random colors for each node
- No semantic meaning
- Visual variety

## Clusters

### Viewing Clusters

**What clusters show:**
- Related ideas grouped together
- Visual grouping
- Relationship strength

**How to identify:**
- Clustered nodes are close together
- Same color often indicates same cluster
- Edges show relationships

### Cluster Analysis

**How to analyze:**
1. Identify clusters visually
2. Click nodes to explore
3. Use "Analyze Idea Cluster" command
4. Review cluster details

## Finding Ideas

### Search in Graph

**How to search:**
- Use search box in UI
- Type idea title or content
- Matching nodes are highlighted
- Focus on search results

### Filter by Category

**How to filter:**
- Select category from dropdown
- Graph shows only that category
- Other categories are hidden
- Clear filter to show all

### Filter by Status

**How to filter:**
- Select status from dropdown
- Graph shows only that status
- Useful for focusing on specific stages
- Clear filter to show all

## Tips

- **Explore relationships** - Click nodes to see connections
- **Use different layouts** - Try hierarchical and force-directed
- **Hover for details** - Quick preview without opening
- **Filter effectively** - Use filters to focus on specific ideas
- **Analyze clusters** - Use cluster analysis for deep dives
